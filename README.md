## Running on istio service mesh(Secured)
Follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/mrevanschan/pizza-istio-demo) if you want to use the docker image I prepared on my Docker Hub account, Otherwise prepare you own image by replace "evanschan" from the following code and run them from root directory:
```
$ mvn clean package
$ docker -t order-generator:latest .
$ docker tag order-generator:lastest evanschan/order-generator
$ docker push evanschan/order-generator
```
After pushing the docker image to your own repository, follow the instructions here  [here](https://github.com/mrevanschan/pizza-istio-demo) to start the istio service mesh
